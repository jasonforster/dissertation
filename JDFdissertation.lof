We then perturb the box shape using three orthogonal infinitesimal strains $\gamma _{xy}$, $\gamma _{xz}$, and $\gamma _{yz}$ in both the positive and negative strain directions, and use the isotropic compression protocol at fixed strain to find the nearest mechanically stable packing with $\phi _J(\gamma )$.
